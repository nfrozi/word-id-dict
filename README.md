# word-id-dict
This repository contains a collection of Indonesian terms (dictionary) gathered and saved using office applications, primarily WPS Office or Microsoft Word, during my time as an editor. It can be used to support spell-checking functions in these applications. Please note that this dictionary is not error-free. Contributions to this repository are welcome.

## How to make use of it?
1. Download the [indonesia.dic](https://github.com/nfrozi/word-id-dict/blob/main/indonesia.dic) file.
2. Open your office application (Word/Writer).
3. Open the Spell Check configuration.
4. Navigate to Custom Dictionaries.
5. Add `indonesia.dic` as one of your custom dictionaries.
6. Apply or save your configuration.
